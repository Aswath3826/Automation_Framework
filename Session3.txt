Automation Framework

Logging - record all the events from the application in the form of text.

Adv of Log files in Automation:
We may run more than 100 testcases which may pass and fail. These files are used to check it and why and where it got failed 

Log Levels - All < Trace < Debug < Info < Warn < Error < Fatal < Off 
Most we use DEBUG and INFO
If developer ask log file,we send DEBUG level log file


Appenders - where to generate logs (Console/File(RollingFile))
Loggers  - what type of logs generate (All < Trace < Debug < Info < Warn < Error < Fatal < Off)
