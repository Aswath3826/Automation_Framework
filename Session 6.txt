Selenium Grid
----------------------------------------

It is used mostly by product based companies to test the application in different enviroments(OS---> mac, windows, Linux...) and their browsers(Chrome,Safari...)

Selenium Grid contains Hub and Nodes(refer doc)
Nodes - Different enviroments
Hub - Selenium Hub - where the nodes connects. We control the procedure of the test from the here

In Test Case(setup), we have setup Grid URL/Node URL(which enviroment), OS and Browser.
To see all these operations(how many nodes, which browser, in which machine it is running....), we use Grid Console URL

Two types:

Standalone Setup (Single machine)
Hub & Node Setup (Multiple machines)


In Setup, For Remote Execution, we use:

DesiredCapabilities cap = new DesiredCapabilities();
//For Platform
cap.setPlatform(Platform.WIN11); //Platform.MAC
//For Browser
cap.setBrowserName("chrome"); // "MicrosoftEdge"
//Driver to RemoteWebdriver
driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL("http://localhost:4444/wd/hub"), cap);

In setup, for local execution we use what we know already.

Setup Selenium (follow the doc steps)

Note: we should not close the cmd and the link after setup. While test execution we can parallelly see the info in the Selenium Grid Environment
      After test execution, in cmd promt we enter "control c" to exit the test
